# SPI tester

This is an SPI test firmware for ESP8266 boards D1 and D1 mini. It serves a web page where you can write a message and send the message over SPI. The ESP8266 works as the SPI main (master).

Network configuration for the ESP8266 goes to the file `wifi_cfg.json`. There is a config template ready to use for an access point. Use 0.0.0.0 for no IP address.
